# Snippets
## A collection of Gist-like snippets for people to read
This is directly linked to by my portfolio pages, cv, etc, as an easy and readable way to review my code, for this reason I will not be accepting pull request either, (subject to change on a case by case basis, for example spelling mistakes will proabably be accepted.)

I chose to organise snippets in this way as to have more control (and organisation) than GitHub GISTs and be a lot more readable than sizable repos with full implementaions, librarys and Unit Tests (this type of thing can be found (sparsely) on my [replit])
